/* This project aims to recreate the game tic tac toe/jeopardy hybrid on a computer using C++ 
 * where players must answer programming questions correctly in order to place their piece.
 * 
 * This edition will be on a 3x3 grid
 * 
 * To do list:
 * - Create a class/structure to store elements. (?)
 * - Create and intialize a function to draw an initial gird for the game, using vectors or arrays to store elements. 
 * - Create a system where the players are allowed to pick which square they want to mark corresponding to the array.
 * - Create a function that flips a coin and/or rock paper scissors to determine which player goes first.
 * - Create a function to randomly select questions from an external text file and appended them to random squares inside
 *   the grid. 
 * - Write an algorithm to check whether or not a player has successfully completed an answer or not, if the player's answer
 *   is correct then mark the square accordingly and if not passes the turn to the following player. The answer check will probably
 *   be manual since verifying the validity of code is very difficult and is on a case by case basis.
 * - Write a function that offers a choice of modes for the game and keep track of score (bo1,bo3,bo5) and also outputs/updates
 *   a text file that keep tracks of all the previous matches
 * - Write a switch case/menu to view different features that the game offers (
